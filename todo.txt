update to readme for cmn layer and main readme 


Document Construction (team2vec as d2v)
Graph Construction (team2vec as gnn)

- embeddings for skills (no need for embeddings for experts for now. in future may want to do skill-experts in input ...)

-- d2v >> docs is collection of skills 
-- contextual >> llm-based
-- gnn-transferred

=======================================================
new change to the skill subset >> skill list for each team, ordered skills
- dblp based on fos score
- gith based on line numbers of the langs
- imdb based on the genre, subgenre, ... the actual order in the dataset

lazy load update 
-- when doing the filtering, we read from scratch. We can load the teams.pkl and filter, and update it. 

update/check cmn.team.Team.get_stats()
update/check cmn.patent.Patent.get_stats()

make cmn.team.Team.get_stats() gpu-friendly
